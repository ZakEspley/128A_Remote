# Part I: The Lorenz Force

By this point in your physics career, you are probably comfortable with the ideas of electrostatics-- the mathematical descriptions of forces and fields that act on and are generated by charged particles at rest. This quarter, you will develop a deeper understanding of magnetism, and hence *electrodynamics*, which are the laws of physics that govern *moving* charges. 

Perhaps the most important equation of you will encounter will be the Lorenz force law:

$$
\vec F = q (\vec E+\vec v \times \vec B)
$$
which describes the force, $\vec F$, that acts on a charge, $q$, moving with a velocity $\vec v$ in the presences of electric and magnetic fields, $\vec E$ and $\vec B$ respectively. This relation is immensely important not only to foundational physics, but also to electrical engineering & various scientific applications: it allows the creation of motors, mass spectrometers, particle detectors and accelerators like the LHC. For aspiring the theorist, this force law should be intrinsically interesting: it's the origin of some [deep, unsolved, mysteries of quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham%E2%80%93Lorentz_force#Signals_from_the_future). For these reasons, our first lab will be a real, tangible investigation of this mysterious force law.


For the purpose of this labratory experiment, we are concerned with the force in the absence of an external electric field, $\vec E = 0$, so our equation will read:
$$
\vec F = q (\vec v \times \vec B)
$$

 AVOCADO: Right hand rule/cross product simulation
:::

This equation gives us two separate and important pieces of information, namely the *direction* and *magnitude* of the resulting force. We can see this by taking the magnitude of both sides of the above equation and applying a formula from vector analysis:

$$
|\vec F| = q |\vec v||\vec B| \sin (\theta)
$$

which gives you the magnitude of the force in terms of the magnitudes and angle $\theta$ between the velocity and magnetic field vectors. AVOCADO: simple explanation of how to get direction by dividing the equations.


Vector equations, if they are new to you, take some getting used to. In plain english, the Lorenz force  law is telling us the following: A charged particle moving with a velocity $\vec v$ in the presence of a magnetic field $\vec B$ will experience a force in a direction that is perpendicular to  both of these vectors, and has a magnitude proportional to their product. To get a feeling for how this works, the simulation below shows the motion of an electron in the $xy-$plane when  subjected to a magnetic field along the $z-$axis

# Part II: Experiments
## 1. Overview
In this lab, we will be dealing with an external magnetic field from Neodymium magnets. Use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force due to the presence of a magnetic field. Match the predictions of the magnetic force direction to observations.

## 2. Calibration of iOLab magnetometer

### Materials needed:
-  iOLab
![](imgs/iolab.jpg)


  
Before making any measurements, it’s crucial to calibrate the magnetometer! First, we need to find a magnetic free space where all experiments will be performed. This means that we need to find a place where magnetic noises are minimized, such as a room with minimal electronic devices, a wooden or non-metal table, and be sure to keep any magnet away from the area. Any metal will affect the magnetic field measurement.

::: Question
Why would metal interfere with the calculation of magnetic field?
:::

####

We will now describe the process you will  use to calibrate the iOLab device via the software.


1. Open the software, click on the “setting” icon (![](imgs/settingicon.png) ), and highlight the "Calibration" menu. Select "Accel-magn-gyro" from the list and follow the instructions shown on the screen. 

:::Figure:Figure
   ![](imgs/calibration_step1.gif)
:::

2. Perform the calibration for the iOLab device’s x, y, z axis separately. The image of the appropriate orientation is shown in the lower right corner of the Calibration window. Note that the longest side is the x axis, the second longest side is the y axis, and the shortest side is the z axis. 
3. After calibrating the three axes, press the “save” button.
####
After completing the above steps, you must now verify your calibration. We will do this in two ways to ensure high-quality data for the analysis porition of your lab:
#### Steps for Verification 1
Here we will check that the axes have been correctly identified by rotating the probe and viewing the response
1. Select “magnetometer” from the list on the left, and you will see $B_x$, $B_y$, and $B_z$ are checked. Uncheck $B_z$ and be prepared to rotate the iOLab along its centered z axis (ie, spin it on the table with the front facing up). 
2. Hit the “record” button to start recording, and rotate the iOLab for about three complete cycles (~360 degress for 3 times). You should see two trajectories with some repeated pattern on the plot. When you have three complete rotations, stop recording.

:::Figure:Figure
   ![](imgs/magverifyx.png)
:::
	 
3. Go to the “parametric plot mode” icon ( ![](imgs/parametricplotmodebutton.png) ) located in the middle of the top panel. On the lower panel, select the whole range of the data with your cursor. The default is plotting magnetometer (y) vs. magnetometer (x). Note that $y$ vs. $x$ means that $y$ is plotted on $y$ axis. 
4. Click on the “tool bar” icon ( ![](imgs/toolbaricon.png) ) in the lower left region, change the first setting to “$B_y$” and the second setting to “$B_x$”. Now you should see an elliptical trajectory on the plot. Make sure that (1) the ellipse is centered around (0, 0). Note that the plot should be circular, but not appear to be a circle due to that x and y axes have different scales. Also, check (2) Δx and Δy are equal on the ellipse. If these two criteria are met, let’s move on to the next step. Otherwise, redo the calibration and repeat this step until the results are good.

:::Figure:Figure
  ![](imgs/xverfiyplot.png)
:::
#### Steps for Verification 2
For the second verification of calibration, we will repeat the same procedure with a different axis of rotation. 
1. Click the “reset” button and go back to “chart mode”. 
2. This time, unselect $B_x$ and put iOLab on its x axis (ie, the face of iOLab should be perpendicular to the table and the bottom should be pointing to the side).
3. Repeat the steps 2-3 of Verification 1. 
4. In “tool bar”, change the first setting to “$B_y$” and the second setting to “$B_z$”. You should see a similar ellipse. Check if the two criteria are satisfied. 

::: Question
Assume the iOLab is functional. If the ellipse is off-center, what might be a possible reason?
:::

## 3. Measure direction and strength of a magnetic field using magnetometer

### Materials needed:
-  iOLab
- Neodymium magnet

The neodymium magnets, composed of various neodynium alloys, are permanent rare-earth magnets that are very strong. In this lab, they will provide an external magnetic field. Our first task is to characterize the magnet by measuring the *direction* and *magnitude* of this field.

 To measure the direction of magnetic field from the Neodymium magnet we will use use the Magnetometer Probe located on the upper left corner of iOLab (next to the “M” label) and the Sensor in the software. 

::: Exercise
Open the software, go to “chart mode”. We can uncheck the $B_x$ and $B_y$ boxes on the plot, and keep only the $z-$component in this experiment. Start recording. You should see a horizontal line on the plot. Hold the magnet with one side facing up, and move it up and down above the magnetometer.

::: Question
Why does $B_z$ changing when you move the magnet vertically? 
:::
####

Now flip the orientation of the magnet and repeat the motion.

####

::: Question
Does the plot behave differently? If yes, describe the observed difference and a possible explanation.
:::

####

By observing how $B_z$ changes with the vertical motion of the magnet, you should be able to tell the direction of the magnetic field. Mark one side with “⨂” to indicate the magnetic field is going into that side, and the other size with “⨀” to indicate the field is going out of this side. You will use these magnets for other labs this quarter.

::: Question
Explain how you determined the magnet's polarity from your data, i.e. which sides represent the magnet's north (⨀) and south (⨂) poles. 
:::

::: Question
Theoretically, how should the strength of the magnetic field depend on distance from the source? Devise a quick experiment which could verify this, and sketch a plot of the expected result.

## 3. Force on current-carrying wire near a magnet
### Materials needed:
- Three Neodymium magnets
- 3-D batteries with battery cage
- Wire Leads
- 12-feet-long wire
- Two 0.5Ω high wattage resistors
- Tape

Most of us don't have access to beams of charged  particles in free space (or methods to observe them easily), making a demonstration of Lorenz's force law similar to the simulation quite impossible. Luckily for us, the force law is ubiquitous, and equally applies to the moving electrons in *materials* such as current-carrying wires. 

In a wire, a current is carried by many electrons moving along its length due to the voltage difference between its ends. When a current-carrying wire is brought close to a magnetic field source, these electrons will be subject to the Lorenz force, whose magnitude and direction is determined by the electron velocities and the external magnetic field. In the following experiment, you will demonstrate and verify the Lorenz force by generating a current though a wire and observing the effect of a magnetic field. 

:::Question
Sketch a picture of a simple wire with a voltage difference across its length. What direction does the velocity vector, $\vec v$, point? 
:::






::: Exercise
In this experiment, we will tape a wire so that it runs perpendicular to the field generated by our magnet. When connecting the wire to the terminals of a battery, such that a current is generated, you will observe and record the effects of the Lorenz force, and explain if it matches your expectations based on the "right hand rule".

To set up the circuit, use the wire leads to connect either end of the battery source to one of the resistors. We will use the long wire to connect two resistors later.
######
Put three Neodymium magnets on your wooden table. They should stick together with the rounded side on the table. Give it a light spin, and you will see it tends to point to one side. If you put it facing the opposite side and roll it, it will flip itself automatically.

::: Question
Why does the magnets trio prefer one orientation?
:::

After the magnet is aligned by itself, tape the back two magnets to the table and keep the front one free from tape. Straighten up the middle part of the 12-feet-long wire and keep this part in front of the magnet. Tape two sides of the wire to the table and leave a ~30cm segment near the middle of the magnet. Make sure the wire is not too tight so that it can move up or down in the presence of a magnetic field.

::: Question
In this setup, why would the magnetic force point along the vertical direction?
:::

Now we want to complete the circuit. Plug one end of the wire into the line on the breadboard where one resistor is in. Do the other end for the other resistor. While the current starts to run in the wire, note the motion of the wire.

::: Question
Write down the direction of the magnetic field from the magnets, the current, and the magnetic force. Verify that they are consistent with the right hand rule.
:::

Switch leads of the long wire. Note that now the current flows in the opposite direction of the previous case.

::: Question
How does the motion of the wire change after switching leads?
:::
:::

:::Question
The Lorenz force acts on the electrons in the wire. Try to explain why the *entire* wire moves, and not just the electrons.
:::

## 4. The Rotating Motor
### Materials needed:
- Neodymium magnets
- Wire Leads (stripped)
- One AAA battery
- One screw

In this set-up, we will be creating a simple homopolar motor. Homopolar motors, first contructed by Michael Faraday in 1821, prior to the discovery of electromagnetism, operate based on the Lorenz force: A conductor with a current flowing through it when placed in a magnetic field, which is perpendicular to the current, feels a force in the direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. This force provides a torque around the axis of rotation



In this exercise we will construct this direct current (DC) motor using a battery as our voltage source and our neodynium magnet as the conductor and perpendicular field source. The magnet will be interfaced with the battery using a screw, whose sharp point has minimal friction and allows for free rotation. When wire leads are used to close the circuit, the current running from the magnet's outer surface to the screw at its center, in conjunction with the magnetic field, will result on a force on the moving *electrons* inside the magnet, causing it to rotate rapidly!

:::Question
AVOCADO: Image of a disk with current source on edge and sink in center. 

The above image shows a disk with a conductive surface connected to a circuit with current $I$. Sketch the path that electrons might take, with arrows indicating the direction of the velocity.
:::

By noting the direction the current is flowing, as well as the direction of the field of the magnets (found in the previous excercise), we can apply the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force, and verify that our results are consistent with the observed direction of rotation.



::: Exercise
With the knowledge of the magnet's orientation from the previous excersie, we will now construct a simple homopolar motor by following the these steps:

1. Strip the plastic from both ends of the wire, exposing the copper strands, allowing the wire to conduct. 
2. Place the flat head of your screw on top of the neodynium magnet, with the north (⨀) pole facing upward. The screw should now also be magnetized so that picking it up also picks up the magnet beneath it.
3. Holding the battery in the air with the positive terminal facing up, touch the negative terminal to the pointed end of the screw. The magnetization should allow you to pick up the screw+ magnet using the battery.
4. Hold one end of your expose wire against the battery's positive terminal.
5. Once everything is connected, gently touch the other end of the wire lead to the side of the magnet (ie, perpendicular to the magnets’ surface)
6. If done correctly, the screw should rotate.

::: Figure:Figure

######

You have now completed the motor set up for one of four possible orientations of the magnet and battery. Make a table like the one below and record your results for all four possible combinations of your battery and magnet orientations:

:::Figure:Table
| Magnet Orienation | Battery Oreintation | Rotation Direction |
| --------  | --------      | --------     |
| (N/S) up  |    (+/-) up   |  (CW/CCW)    |                    
| "         |               |              |  
| "         |               |              | 
| "         |               |              | 
:::
Note that flipping the magnet changes the field, and flipping the battery changes the current. In each case, you should note the direction of the current and the magnetic field to find the direction of the magnetic force. You can then explain if this magnetic force would cause the rotation in the direction of which you are observing.


Recall from our previous discussion that when these fields are perpendicular, $\sin(\theta)=1$ . Hence, $F= I B$, and the direction of the force is given by the right-hand rule. Because this current is localized to the region of the magnet connecting the wire to the nail, the force acting upon  the individual electrons results in a torque that spins the entire magnet. You will use the right-hand rule to predict the direction that the magnet will spin based upon the orientation of both the battery and the magnets.

::: Question
Sketch an illustration giving a “view from above” to show each of the 4 possibilities. Also include arrows which show the direction of the magnetic force from the right hand rule, and labels to indicate the direction of current flow.
