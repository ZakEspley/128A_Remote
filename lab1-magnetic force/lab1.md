# Part I: The Lorenz Force

By this point in your physics career, you are probably comfortable with the ideas of electrostatics-- the mathematical descriptions of forces and fields that act on and are generated by charged particles at rest. This quarter, you will develop a deeper understanding of magnetism, and hence *electrodynamics*, which are the laws of physics that govern *moving* charges. 

Perhaps the most important equation of you will encounter will be the Lorenz force law:

$$
\vec F = q (\vec E+\vec v \times \vec B)
$$
which describes the force, $\vec F$, that acts on a charge, $q$, moving with a velocity $\vec v$ in the presences of electric and magnetic fields, $\vec E$ and $\vec B$ respectively. This relation is immensely important not only to foundational physics, but also to electrical engineering & various scientific applications: it allows the creation of motors, mass spectrometers, particle detectors and accelerators like the LHC. For aspiring the theorist, this force law should be intrinsically interesting: it's the origin of some [deep, unsolved, mysteries of quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham%E2%80%93Lorentz_force#Signals_from_the_future). For these reasons, our first lab will be a real, tangible investigation of this mysterious force law.


For the purpose of this labratory experiment, we are concerned with the force in the absence of an external electric field, $\vec E = 0$, so our equation will read:
$$
\vec F = q (\vec v \times \vec B)
$$

 AVOCADO: Right hand rule/cross product simulation
:::

This equation gives us two separate and important pieces of information, namely the *direction* and *magnitude* of the resulting force. We can see this by taking the magnitude of both sides of the above equation and applying a formula from vector analysis:

$$
|\vec F| = q |\vec v||\vec B| \sin (\theta)
$$

which gives you the magnitude of the force in terms of the magnitudes and angle $\theta$ between the velocity and magnetic field vectors. AVOCADO: simple explanation of how to get direction by dividing the equations.


Vector equations, if they are new to you, take some getting used to. In plain english, the Lorenz force  law is telling us the following: A charged particle moving with a velocity $\vec v$ in the presence of a magnetic field $\vec B$ will experience a force in a direction that is perpendicular to  both of these vectors, and has a magnitude proportional to their product. To get a feeling for how this works, the simulation below shows the motion of an electron in the $xy-$plane when  subjected to a magnetic field along the $z-$axis

# Part II: Experiments
## 1. Overview
In this lab, we will get familiar with the iOlab by investigating the external magnetic field of a Neodymium magnet. After learning how to use the iOlab, we will study the force experienced by moving electrons in a magnetic field. We have the following goals:
 - Use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force due to the presence of a magnetic field. 
 - Match the predictions of the magnetic force direction to observations.
 -  Demonstrate that the Lorenz force can be converted into mechanical work by constructing a simple motor

## 2. Calibration of iOLab magnetometer

### Materials needed:
-  iOLab
![](imgs/iolab.jpg)


  
Before making any measurements, it’s crucial to calibrate the magnetometer! During calibration, the magnetometer will use the Earth's magnetic field in conjunction with its gyroscope to determine its relative orientation. During this step (and in subsequent labs), it is important that we find an open space, free of electric and magnetic fields, that can skew the calibration step. An appropriate place may be a room with minimal electronic devices or on top of a wooden/nonmetallic table. Be sure to remove any magnets and metals from the experiment area, especially during calibration.

::: Question
Why would metal interfere with the calculation of magnetic field?
:::

####

We will now describe the process you will  use to calibrate the iOLab device via the software.


1. Open the software, click on the “setting” icon (![](imgs/settingicon.png) ), and highlight the "Calibration" menu. Select "Accel-magn-gyro" from the list and follow the instructions shown on the screen. 

:::Figure:Figure
   ![](imgs/calibration_step1.gif)
:::

2. Perform the calibration for the iOLab device’s $x, y, z$ axis separately. The image of the appropriate orientation is shown in the lower right corner of the Calibration window. Note that the longest side is the x axis, the second longest side is the y axis, and the shortest side is the z axis. 
3. After calibrating the three axes, press the “save” button.
####
After completing the above steps, you must now verify your calibration. We will do this in two ways to ensure high-quality data for the analysis porition of your lab:
#### Steps for Verification 1
Here we will check that the axes have been correctly identified by rotating the probe and viewing the response
1. Select “magnetometer” from the list on the left, and you will see $B_x$, $B_y$, and $B_z$ are checked. Uncheck $B_z$ and be prepared to rotate the iOLab along its centered z axis (ie, spin it on the table with the front facing up). 
2. Hit the “record” button to start recording, and rotate the iOLab for about three complete cycles (~360 degress for 3 times). You should see two trajectories with some repeated pattern on the plot. When you have three complete rotations, stop recording.

:::Figure:Figure
   ![](imgs/magverifyx.png)
:::
	 
3. Go to the “parametric plot mode” icon ( ![](imgs/parametricplotmodebutton.png) ) located in the middle of the top panel. On the lower panel, select the whole range of the data with your cursor. The default is plotting magnetometer (y) vs. magnetometer (x). Note that $y$ vs. $x$ means that $y$ is plotted on $y$ axis. 
4. Click on the “tool bar” icon ( ![](imgs/toolbaricon.png) ) in the lower left region, change the first setting to “$B_y$” and the second setting to “$B_x$”. Now you should see an elliptical trajectory on the plot. Make sure that 
- - the ellipse is centered around (0, 0). Note that the plot should be circular, but not appear to be a circle due to that $x$ and $y$ axes have different scales. 
- - $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ are equal on the ellipse. If these two criteria are met, let’s move on to the next step. Otherwise, redo the calibration and repeat this step until the results are good.

:::Figure:Figure
  ![](imgs/xverfiyplot.png)
:::
#### Steps for Verification 2
For the second verification of calibration, we will repeat the same procedure with a different axis of rotation. 
1. Click the “reset” button and go back to chart mode (  ![](imgs/chartmodebutton.png)). 
2. This time, unselect $B_x$ and put iOLab on its x axis (ie, the face of iOLab should be perpendicular to the table and the bottom should be pointing to the side).
3. Repeat the steps 2-3 of Verification 1. 
4. In “tool bar”, change the first setting to “$B_y$” and the second setting to “$B_z$”. You should see a similar ellipse. Check if the two criteria are satisfied. 

::: Question
(a) Assume the iOLab is functional. If the ellipse is off-center, what might be a possible reason?
(b) Why do you think the ellipse is not perfectly "smooth" ? Give some possible explanations.

## 3. Measure direction and strength of a magnetic field using magnetometer

### Materials needed:
-  iOLab
- Neodymium magnet

The neodymium magnets, composed of various neodynium alloys, are permanent rare-earth magnets that are very strong. In this lab, they will provide an external magnetic field. Our first task is to characterize the magnet by measuring the *direction* and *magnitude* of this field.

 To measure the direction of magnetic field from the Neodymium magnet we will use use the Magnetometer Probe located on the upper left corner of iOLab (next to the “M” label) and the Sensor in the software. 

::: Exercise
Open the software, go to “chart mode”(  ![](imgs/chartmodebutton.png)). We can uncheck the $B_x$ and $B_y$ boxes on the plot, and keep only the $z-$component in this experiment. Start recording. You should see a horizontal line on the plot. Hold the magnet with one side facing up, and move it up and down above the magnetometer.

::: Question
Why does $B_z$ change when you move the magnet vertically? 
:::
####

Now flip the orientation of the magnet and repeat the motion.

####

::: Question
Does the plot behave differently? If yes, describe the observed difference and a possible explanation.
:::

####

By observing how $B_z$ changes with the vertical motion of the magnet, you should be able to tell the direction of the magnetic field. Mark one side with “⨂” to indicate the magnetic field is going into that side, and the other size with “⨀” to indicate the field is going out of this side. You will use these magnets for other labs this quarter.

::: Question
Explain how you determined the magnet's polarity from your data, i.e. which sides represent the magnet's north (⨀) and south (⨂) poles. 
:::

::: Question
Theoretically, how should the strength of the magnetic field depend on distance from the source? Devise a quick experiment which could verify this, and sketch a plot of the expected result.  
:::
:::

## 4. Measure the field around a magnetic source
### Materials needed:
-  iOLab
- Neodymium magnet
- Steel Screw
- Ruler and Tape

In the last question, we asked you to sketch a graph of how you expect the magnetic field strength to change with distance. As your final exercise in getting familiar with the iOLab, you will attempt to  verify this prediction quantitatively. 

::: Exercise
Magnetic force behaves similar to the Coulomb law --- it should fall off with $1/r^2$ in an ideal situation. We will test how accurately the inverse-square law captures real the behavior of a real magnet and sensor.

:::Question 
If magnetic force falls off with the inverse square of distance, how should the magnitude of the force $F(r)$ measured at a point change after doubling the distance to the magnet?
:::

Use the reset button to clear all measurements, and follow the instructions below. 

:::Figure:Figure
  ![](imgs/magsetup.jpg)
:::

1. On the magnetometer graph panel, uncheck all data except for $B_z$
2. Tape the ruler to the edge of a table and align the iOLab, with the $x-axis$ pointing up, such that the $M$ symbol is  aligned with the 0 cm mark. 
3. Attach your magnet to the flat end of a steel screw to make handling easier. Align the magnet with the 1cm mark on the ruler.
5. Record about 1 second of data and stop.
6. Double the distance to 2cm, 4cm, 8cm and record 1 second of data each.
7. For each measurement made above, highlight the 1 second interval that data was taken and record the average and the distance of the measurement in a table.

AVOCADO: gifs demonstrating these steps

:::Question 
For each doubling, calculate the ratio of the magnetic force. Do the ratios match your expectations from Question 7? Do some ratios match better than others? Why do you think this is the case?
:::

## 5. Force on current-carrying "wire" near a magnet
### Materials needed:
- Neodymium magnet
- 1 wire lead
- One AA battery
- Steel screw
- Thin strip of Aluminum foil, approximately 15 cm long
- Tape
- Paper towel roll or similar, cut into a 1in and 2in section
- Piece of paper (optional)


Most of us don't have access to beams of charged  particles in free space (or methods to observe them easily), making a demonstration of Lorenz's force law similar to the simulation above quite impossible. Luckily for us, the force law is ubiquitous, and equally applies to the moving electrons in *materials* --- such as current-carrying wires. 

In a wire, a current is carried by many electrons moving along its length due to the voltage difference between its ends --- recall that, in this case, $\vec I = q \vec v$. When a current-carrying wire is brought close to a magnetic field source, these electrons will be subject to the Lorenz force, whose magnitude and direction is determined by the electron velocities and the external magnetic field. In the following experiment, you will demonstrate and verify the Lorenz force by generating a current though a wire and observing the effect of a magnetic field. 

:::Question
Sketch a picture of a simple wire with a voltage difference across its length. What direction does the velocity vector, $\vec v$, point? 
:::






::: Exercise
In this experiment, we will tape a strip of aluminum foil, which behaves as a "wire",  so that it runs perpendicular to the field generated by our magnet. When connecting the foil to the terminals of a battery, such that a current is generated, you will observe and record the effects of the Lorenz force, and explain if it matches your expectations based on the "right hand rule". The reason for using foil is its thickness --- it is much easier to observe "bending" in foil vs stiffer wire. 
:::Figure:Figure
  ![](imgs/foilsetup.jpg)
:::
1. Tape the aluminum foil strip to the 1 in roll section so that it runs across the diameter. The foil should have minimal tension so that it can bend slightly.
2. Place this with the foil up on a piece of paper (or table) and use tape to fasten the aluminum foil to the paper on either side, being sure to leave an expose region.
3. On one side, tape the exposed wire lead to the aluminum foil.
4. Attach the magnet to the flat end of the screw
5. Place the 2in tube parallel to the foil and push the screw through it so that magnet sits just perpendicular to the foil strip.
6. Hold the battery on the exposed foil, and gently touch the opposite terminal with the wire to close the circuit
7. Note the orientations of the magnet and direction of current and record the direction of motion of the foil
######

::: Question
Write down the direction of the magnetic field from the magnets, the current, and the magnetic force. Verify that they are consistent with the right hand rule.
:::

Repeat this experiment for all four combinations of magnet orientation and battery orientation. Make a table simlar to the following to record your results for each magnet and battery orientation, the prediction for the force direction given by the right hand rule and the observed direction of foil movement:
:::Figure:Table
| Magnet Orienation | Battery Oreintation | RHR |Foil Direction |
| --------  | --------      | --------     |--------     |
| (N/S) toward foil  |    (+/-) up   |  (up/down)    |           (up/down)    |               
| "         |               |              |          |
| "         |               |              |           |
| "         |               |              |           |
:::

::: Question
How does the motion of the wire change after switching battery orientation? Why?
:::


:::Question
The Lorenz force acts on the electrons in the foil. Try to explain why the *entire* foil moves, and not just the electrons.
:::
:::
## 6. The Rotating Motor
### Materials needed:
- Neodymium magnets
- Wire Leads (stripped)
- One AAA battery
- One screw

In this set-up, we will be creating a simple homopolar motor. Homopolar motors, first constructed by Michael Faraday in 1821, prior to the discovery of electromagnetism, operate based on the Lorenz force: A conductor with a current flowing through it when placed in a magnetic field, which is perpendicular to the current, feels a force in the direction perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current. This force provides a torque around the axis of rotation



In this exercise we will construct this direct current (DC) motor using a battery as our voltage source and our neodynium magnet as the conductor and perpendicular field source. The magnet will be interfaced with the battery using a screw, whose sharp point has minimal friction and allows for free rotation. When wire leads are used to close the circuit, the current running from the magnet's outer surface to the screw at its center, in conjunction with the magnetic field, will result on a force on the moving *electrons* inside the magnet, causing it to rotate rapidly!

:::Question
AVOCADO: Image of a disk with current source on edge and sink in center. 

The above image shows a disk with a conductive surface connected to a circuit with current $I$. Sketch the path that electrons might take, with arrows indicating the direction of the velocity.
:::

By noting the direction the current is flowing, as well as the direction of the field of the magnets (found in the previous excercise), we can apply the right-hand rule to determine the direction of the magnetic force, and verify that our results are consistent with the observed direction of rotation.



::: Exercise
With the knowledge of the magnet's orientation from the previous exercise, we will now construct a simple homopolar motor by following the these steps:

1. Strip the plastic from both ends of the wire, exposing the copper strands, allowing the wire to conduct. 
2. Place the flat head of your screw on top of the neodynium magnet, with the north (⨀) pole facing upward. The screw should now also be magnetized so that picking it up also picks up the magnet beneath it.
3. Holding the battery in the air with the positive terminal facing up, touch the negative terminal to the pointed end of the screw. The magnetization should allow you to pick up the screw+ magnet using the battery.
4. Hold one end of your expose wire against the battery's positive terminal.
5. Once everything is connected, gently touch the other end of the wire lead to the side of the magnet (ie, perpendicular to the magnets’ surface)
6. If done correctly, the screw should rotate.

::: Figure:Figure
![motor](imgs/1.png)
:::
######

You have now completed the motor set up for one of four possible orientations of the magnet and battery. Make a table like the one below and record your results for all four possible combinations of your battery and magnet orientations, prediction based on the right hand rule, and the observered direction:

:::Figure:Table
| Magnet Orienation | Battery Oreintation | RHR|Rotation Direction |
| --------  | --------      | --------     |--------     |
| (N/S) up  |    (+/-) up   | (CW/CCW)  | (CW/CCW)    |                    
| "         |               |              |  |
| "         |               |              | |
| "         |               |              | |
:::
Note that flipping the magnet changes the field, and flipping the battery changes the current. In each case, you should note the direction of the current and the magnetic field to find the direction of the magnetic force. You can then explain if this magnetic force would cause the rotation in the direction of which you are observing.


Recall from our previous discussion that when these fields are perpendicular, $\sin(\theta)=1$ . Hence, $F= I B$, and the direction of the force is given by the right-hand rule. Because this current is localized to the region of the magnet connecting the wire to the nail, the force acting upon  the individual electrons results in a torque that spins the entire magnet. You will use the right-hand rule to predict the direction that the magnet will spin based upon the orientation of both the battery and the magnets.

::: Question
Sketch an illustration giving a “view from above” to show each of the 4 possibilities. Also include arrows which show the direction of the magnetic force from the right hand rule, and labels to indicate the direction of current flow.
